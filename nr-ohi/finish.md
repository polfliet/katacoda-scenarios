You now have some experience in installing a New Relic On Host Integration.  There are many other OHIs that support a lot of different technologies.  You can see the full list of supported and open-source OHIs at:

- [docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list)
- [docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/open-source-host-integrations-list)

Once installed, the information collected by the OHIs will be displayed in our curated out-of-box dashboards, used to drive analytics, and also can be leveraged to create custom dashboards and data visualizations.
