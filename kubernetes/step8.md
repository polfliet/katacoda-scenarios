There are many moving parts in a Kubernetes cluster. New Relic's Kubernetes cluster explorer allows you to:
* Quickly see where your pods are running
* Understand resource consumption in the cluster (with relation to your resource requests & limits)
* Focus on problematic pods & nodes
* Easily filter on namespace, deployment, etc.
* Track dynamic behavior by seeing all events happening in the cluster
* Correlate pods with application performance
* Analyze logs coming from your containers
